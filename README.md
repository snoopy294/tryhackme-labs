## Completed Labs

### Network Traffic and Packet Analysis

| Lab | Tools | Highlights |
|-----|-------|-----------|
| **TShark Challenge I & II** | TShark | Parsed PCAPs, extracted attacker commands, identified anomalous packet sequences and lateral movement behavior |
| **Zeek Exercises** | Zeek | Analyzed network metadata, mapped observed behaviors to MITRE ATT&CK tactics |
| **Masterminds** | Brim | Investigated malicious flows, pivoted across logs to identify beaconing patterns |
| **Stolen Mount** | Linux, PCAP | Investigated unauthenticated SMB access attempts and potential data exfiltration |

### Intrusion Detection & Attack Monitoring

| Lab | Tools | Highlights |
|-----|-------|-----------|
| **Snort Challenge – The Basics** | Snort | Authored and tuned custom Snort rules to detect targeted attack patterns |
| **Snort Challenge – Live Attacks** | Snort | Monitored active traffic, detected brute-force and exploitation events |
| **Monday Monitor** | Linux | Detected anomalous endpoint events using system monitoring utilities |
| **Hide and Seek** | Linux | Identified persistence mechanisms and post-compromise artifacts |

---

### Incident Response & Host Forensics

| Lab | Platform | Highlights |
|-----|----------|-----------|
| **Disgruntled** | Linux | Investigated insider misuse and traced unauthorized account activity |
| **Infinity Shell** | Linux | Identified and analyzed a malicious webshell and attacker pivot techniques |
| **Benign** | Web | Conducted complete host triage, isolated IoCs, identified compromise vector |
| **Friday Overtime** | Threat Intel | Reviewed adversary activity and linked it to known threat actor behavior |

---

### SIEM & Log Analysis

| Lab | Platform | Highlights |
|-----|----------|-----------|
| **Investigating with Splunk** | Splunk | Queried logs to detect privilege escalation and anomalous authentication attempts |
| **ItsyBitsy** | Elastic (ELK) | Correlated events across endpoints to reconstruct an intrusion timeline |
| **Snapped Phish-ing Line / Greenholt Phish** | Email Analysis | Parsed malicious headers, URLs, and phishing artifacts to identify social engineering indicators |

---

## Key Takeaways

Through these labs, I developed workflows for:

- Correlating multi-source logs to identify Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)  
- Detecting attacker persistence, lateral movement, and privilege escalation  
- Writing and tuning IDS signatures for Snort-based detection  
- Conducting packet-level investigations using TShark, Zeek, and Brim  
- Performing host-based forensics and triage on Linux and Windows systems  
- Mapping observed activity to MITRE ATT&CK techniques

## Summary

> Demonstrated SOC-aligned experience across SIEM monitoring, packet analysis, threat hunting, and digital forensics. Comfortable analyzing adversary behavior and providing defensible investigative findings using Splunk, Elastic, Snort, Zeek, and TShark.
